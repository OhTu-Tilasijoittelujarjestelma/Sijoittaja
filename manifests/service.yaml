# Let us create a file service.yaml into the manifests folder.
#  We need the service to do the following things:

#  Declare that we want a Service
#  Declare which port to listen to
#  Declare the application where the request should be directed to
#  Declare the port where the request should be directed to

  name: sijoittaja-svc

  selector:
    app: sijoittaja # This is the app as declared in the deployment.
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 6443 # This is a port that is available to the cluster, in this case it can be ~ anything
      targetPort: 4173 # This is the target port
